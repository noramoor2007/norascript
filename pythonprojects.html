  <h2>Python Projects</h2>
  <p>Python is a high-level (in the realm of computer science), general programming language. The philosophy behind the design of Python emphasizes its readability. Like JavaScript, Objective-C, which is used when writing software for OS X and iOS, PHP, Ruby, Lisp, and Tcl , Python is a dynamically typed and garbage-collected program, which means that it periodically frees and reclaims blocks of memory that no longer are in use. In addition, Python "supports multiple programming paradigms, which include structured, object-oriented and functional programming" (Wikipedia).
