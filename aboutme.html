  <p class = "Descriptions">My name is Nora Moor, and I’m a junior in high school, set to graduate in 2025. I have a strong passion for STEM fields, specifically computer science, and I plan to major in it. I’m proud to have received multiple notable accolades in computer science and have recently taken part in hackathons, where I excel in collaborative problem-solving. As the head of my school’s Computer Science club, I am responsible for leading initiatives to foster learning and innovation within our community. My interests extend beyond STEM and into music composition, where I enjoy creating orchestra concertos, quintets, and piano solos. I am looking forward to exploring the intersection of technology and creativity in my academic and professional journey.</p>
