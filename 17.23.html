  <h1>2023-2024 Coding Portfolio</h1>
  <h2>My Coding History Timeline</h2>
  <p>2017 - I started coding at school in Scratch, in my computer class, using scratch.mit.edu.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>2018 - I continued using Scratch and made many projects. I was inspired by this online game that I used to play called Meow Playground. I really wanted to have the most amount of coins out of everyone in that game, and I did for some time, with 6 million coins. I wanted to try and hack the game and first discovered the inspect function. I wanted to create my own game that was like that game where I could give myself as many coins as I wanted, and I worked on it for a whole year.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>2019 - Continued using Scratch.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>2020 - Continued using Scratch.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>2021 - Continued using Scratch, but wanted to do more than just Scratch, so I signed up for Columbia University's Pre-College Program over the summer, and learned how to code in Python for 3 weeks online. It was challenging because it was my first time learning how to code using an actual real coding languages, but I was motivated to do my best, because my entire goal was to be able to create something like a website that I can customize on my own and be as creative as I wanted to be.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>2022 - I continued practicing coding in Python and did more projects in Scratch, and applied again to Columbia University's Pre-College Program, and was excited to hear that I could attend in-person. I learned so much Java and loved to practice it at my free time. I made numerous projects as well. Additionally, after the three weeks, I attended another camp where I learned how to code in R, using R Studio and worked on a project for months that I eventually presented to the public and at my school.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>2023 - I decided to pick up Python again because I felt like if I really wanted to be able to say that I know Python, I want to be able to have mastered it. I signed up for Inspirit AI where I learned how to code more statistically in Python, and tomorrow (Sunday, June 4th), I will be presenting my final project that measures exoplanets and non exoplanets. I also took a graduate course in March where I learned how to code in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Every session was 7.5 hours long, but I enjoyed every last bit of it. I decided that I want to continue using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, and all the other coding languages, and compile all my projects into a portfolio. I finally achieved my goal after years of trying to create a website from scratch with pure code. I am so ecstatic to discover and witness all the different things I can do and create with coding. During school free hours, I began working and still am working on projects that I want to put on my portfolio, I created a quiz, using Python, that determines a user's personality type, and also am working on a program that is more Chemistry related, and basically uses the Periodic Table of Elements and the properties of these elements to allow the user to enter an element and learn more about that element, or the opposite way where they can enter information about an unknown element to figure out what the element is. Now I am currently attending Columbia University's Pre-College Program, where I am learning how to code in C/C++.</p>
